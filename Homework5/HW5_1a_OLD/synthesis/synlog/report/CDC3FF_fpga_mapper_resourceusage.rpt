Global Clock Buffers: 1

Total LUTs:    2

Extra resources required for RAM and MACC interface logic during P&R:

RAM64x18 Interface Logic : SLEs = 0; LUTs = 0;
RAM1K18  Interface Logic : SLEs = 0; LUTs = 0;
MACC     Interface Logic : SLEs = 0; LUTs = 0;

Total number of SLEs after P&R:  4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4;
Total number of LUTs after P&R:  2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2;
