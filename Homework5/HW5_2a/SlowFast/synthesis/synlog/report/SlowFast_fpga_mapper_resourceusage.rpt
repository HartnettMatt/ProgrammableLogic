DSP Blocks:    0 of 22 (0%)

I/O ports: 7
I/O primitives: 7
INBUF          3 uses
OUTBUF         4 uses


Global Clock Buffers: 3

Total LUTs:    2

Extra resources required for RAM and MACC interface logic during P&R:

RAM64x18 Interface Logic : SLEs = 0; LUTs = 0;
RAM1K18  Interface Logic : SLEs = 0; LUTs = 0;
MACC     Interface Logic : SLEs = 0; LUTs = 0;

Total number of SLEs after P&R:  14 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 14;
Total number of LUTs after P&R:  2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2;
