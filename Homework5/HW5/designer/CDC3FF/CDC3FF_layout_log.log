Info: No timing constraint has been associated to the 'Place and Route' tool. 'Place and Route' will be run in non Timing Driven mode.
INFO: The option "Abort flow if errors are found in PDC" is turned ON in Project Settings> Design flow page. The Place & Route tool will fail if errors are found in associated PDC files. Please uncheck the option to ignore the errors and continue running the tool

Warning:  The following clocks are routed using regular routing resources instead of dedicated global resources. Clocks using regular routing are more susceptible to noise than those using dedicated global resources. Microchip recommends promoting these signals to dedicated global resources.
